With [formal introductions](https://app.tinyletter.com/#!/messages/5120657/report) out of the way, we can jump right to it!
Perhaps you tried some tea after the last post. Maybe trying tea has been on your mind, but you haven't gotten around to it yet. Maybe you just want to try something new. Whichever "category" you put yourself in doesn't matter. My only hope is that this post will make it easier for you to try improving your health and wellness. If you can boil water, if you have some pocket change to buy teabags, and if you know how to drink (I'll just assume that you do), you're about as ready as you can be. Let's get to it then!

### Red Rooibos Tea
Though this tea is not as well-known as, say, green tea or black tea, it ought to be. It's one of my favorites. The "aftertaste" is not too strong and as a result rooibos tea is quite soothing and calming. For caffeine-sensitive people, no worries! Rooibos tea is caffeine-free and is noted to help people sleep better.

Other [health benefits](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/beverage/health-benefits-of-red-rooibos-tea.html) include relieving stress/nervous
tension, improving heart health, easing stomach aches and abdominal pain, and acting as an anti-aging product. The list could go on and on. If you're interested, give this one a try!

### Chamomile Tea
I'll be honest with you: I haven't tried this tea all that much. So, for those new to teas, we're on the same boat here. After
some research, though, I've found that chamomile tea is a great choice if you're stressed and having trouble sleeping. It is a noted sleep-inducer, aiding those with sleeping disorders (like sleep apnea) in getting a good night's rest. I think we've all been there before: losing sleep due to stress from school, work, our personal lives, etc. So, whenever you have bouts of sleepless nights, look no further than chamomile tea!

Other [health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-benefits-of-chamomile-tea) include boosting immune systems, relieving stress/anxiety, improving skin health, and treating stomach irritations. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

### Traditional Korean Plum Tea
I'll end with a personal favorite. The fruit-based Korean plum tea is not actually made out of plums but rather from extracts of Japanese apricots otherwise known as "green plums". (But, I guess "plum tea" sounds catchier than "Japanese apricot tea.") Admittedly, plum tea is not readily available because it's relatively unknown outside of South Korea. However, I can confirm, it is available on Amazon.

And... plum tea is worth it. Why? Because it tastes great and [calms upset stomachs](http://lovehealthnature.blogspot.com/2016/03/health-benefit-of-plum-tea-health-with.html). I can personally vouch for plum tea's healthy properties.  Long story short, I was in Korea, had a stomach ache, tried some plum tea, and lo and behold, I felt much better. Maybe this was the result of a placebo effect. But, in the end, who cares? The plum tea tasted good, I had a nice drink, tried something new, and felt better afterwards. Whatever the case may be, I highly recommend it!

Well, it's time to wrap things up. I hope you enjoyed this brief (but hopefully helpful) two-part series on tea's health benefits. It's never too late to start and remember, preparing a cup of tea only takes a few minutes. Too busy? I don't think so!
