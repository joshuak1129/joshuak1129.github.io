# 3 Teas You MUST Try to Feel Tea-riffic! (Part 2)

With formal introductions out of the way, we can jump right into the heart of things!
Perhaps you tried some tea after the last post. Maybe trying some tea has been
on your mind for a while, but you haven't gotten around to it yet. Or maybe
you're not all that interested but, at the same time, want to try something new
or different. Whichever "category" you put yourself in doesn't matter.
This post is for everyone: the tea enthusiasts, the skeptics, the curious onlookers, whoever. My only hope is that this post will
make it easier for you to try something new while improving your health and
wellness. If you can boil water, if you have some pocket change to buy teabags,
and if you know how to drink (I'll just assume that you all do), you're about
as ready as you can be. Let's get to it then!

###### Red Rooibos Tea
Though this tea is not as well-known as, say, green tea or black tea, it ought
to be. It's one of my favorites. The "aftertaste" is not too strong and as a
result rooibos tea is quite soothing and calming. For caffeine-sensitive people,
no worries! Rooibos tea is caffeine-free and actually has been noted to help
people sleep better. Some other health benefits include relieving stress/nervous
tension, improving heart health, easing stomach aches and abdominal pain, and
acting as an anti-aging product. The list could go on and on (really, look above)
so, if you're interested, give this one a try!

###### Chamomile Tea
I'll be honest with you: I haven't tried this tea all that much. So, for those
who haven't tried this variety, it looks like we're on the same boat. After
some research, though, I've found that this is a great choice if you're stressed
and thus having trouble sleeping. Chamomile tea is a noted sleep-inducer, aiding
those with sleep apnea or other sleeping disorders in getting a good night's
rest. I think we've all been there before: losing sleep while stressing about
school, work, our personal lives, etc. So, whenever you have bouts of sleepless
nights, look no further than chamomile tea! It just may be the right thing for
you. Other health benefits include boosting your immune system, relieving stress/
anxiety, improving skin health, and treating stomach irritations. Sounds like a
pretty good deal to me.

###### Traditional Korean Plum Tea
I'll end with one of my favorites. The Korean plum tea. It's actually fruit-based.
What's funny is that it's not actually made out of plums but rather from extracts of Japanese apricots (otherwise known as "green plums"). But, I guess "plum tea" has
a better ring to it than "Japanese apricot tea." Though I admit that this tea is
harder to get than others (because it's not readily known outside of South Korea),
it is available on Amazon (I checked!) and it's worth it. Why? Because it tastes great
and calms an upset stomach. I can vouch for this with personal experience. Simply put,
I was in Korea, had a stomach ache, tried some plum tea, and lo and behold, I felt
much better. Maybe it was psychological, but who cares? It tasted good, I had a nice
drink, tried something new, and felt better afterwards. Whatever the case may be,
I highly recommend it!

Well, it looks like it's time to wrap things up. I hope you enjoyed this brief
(but hopefully helpful) two-part series on tea's health benefits. It's never too
late to start and remember, it only takes a few minutes to prepare a cup of tea.
Too busy? To spare a few minutes in a day? I don't think so!
