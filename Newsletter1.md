Ah, think back: It's New Year's Day and you have your exciting list of New Year's resolutions. It glimmers with a sense of hope and possibility. Perhaps improving your health/wellness was on that list. Fast-forward a few months. Are you finding now that your health/wellness has taken a backseat to school, work, and hanging out with friends? Well, you're not alone. According to a survey, only 8% of people actually keep their New Year's resolutions. No doubt, our increasingly busy, demanding lives play a role in our failures to keep our resolutions.

Health/wellness has morphed from simply pertaining to one's lifestyle to being a cultural phenomenon on the "pop culture" scene. And yet, with our demanding schedules and obligations, even with the constant reminders that we ought to take care of ourselves, exercising or spending time at the grocery store to carefully watch what you eat is difficult. If you're strapped for time, you can always start with something small and simple, and maybe this little act will provide a much-needed jumpstart to improving your health.

Simply put, drink some tea! It only takes a few minutes to boil some water and before you know it, you'll be sipping that tea, looking sophisticated and classy while drinking something that actively works to make you feel better, to feel healthier. Plus, you can carry tea around with you throughout the day. Below, I'll list some teas that I'd recommend.

###### Green tea:
Arguably the most well-known tea available with a whole host of health benefits. One resource asserts that it is one of the healthiest drinks that you can find on the planet. Dr. Christopher Ochner, a research scientist at the Icahn School of Medicine, says it's "the healthiest thing [he] can think of to drink." So, what's all the hype around green tea? Well, let's find out.

First, green tea has been known to improve blood flow and lower cholesterol. Improved blood flow, as you may have guessed, also contributes to a healthier heart and brain. For example, one study revealed through MRIs that people who regularly drank green tea had more activity in the "working memory" part of their brain. Furthermore, green tea aids healthy cells in all stages of growth. However, if you're sensitive to caffeine, please be aware that green tea is caffeinated.

###### Black tea:
Also a very popular and well-known tea. And just like green tea, it has many impressive health benefits. Black tea is reported to have beneficial impacts on high cholesterol, diarrhea, tooth decay, low-concentration, and digestive problems. According to a study by Boston School of Medicine, it "reverses the abnormal functioning of blood vessels, which may lead to strokes and other cardiovascular conditions." But again, if you're sensitive to caffeine, try to avoid black tea, especially in the later hours of the day. Black tea is actually known to have more caffeine than green tea.

###### Lemon-ginger tea:
Undergoing a bout of nausea? Having digestion problems? Looking to boost your metabolism? Well, look no further, and try some lemon-ginger tea! Though it's not as well-known as green tea or black tea (maybe some of you are hearing about it for the first time), it's equally great for your health and is one of my personal favorites! It actually tastes pretty decent and a cup of lemon-ginger tea every morning can help you to burn more calories throughout the day. Other benefits include boosting immune systems, reducing fevers, improving cognition, improving hair growth/quality, and promoting the growth of new cells.

That's all for now (more coming in Part 2!) but give these teas a try! It'll only take a few minutes out of your day (for all those busy people out there), and best of all, you'll feel yourself getting healthier and healthier, sip by sip!
